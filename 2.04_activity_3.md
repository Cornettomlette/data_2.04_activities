# 2.04 Activity 3

#### Queries and questions

1. Can you use the following query:

```sql
select * from bank.district
where a3 like 'north%M%';
```

instead of:

```sql
select * from bank.district
where a3 like 'north_M%';
```

Try both the queries and check the results.

2. We looked at the following query in class:

```sql
select * from bank.district
where a2 regexp 'ch[e-r]';
```

Can you modify the query to print the rows only for those values in the **A2** column that starts with **'CH'**?
